# WhereRU
This is a simple app that provides returns current location upon request with a single tap on the screen. 
Intended purpose is to easily send your location to the caller while driving, riding, commuting or otherwise being unable 
to talk or type. 
The app UI has two buttons - smaller one to request location from one of your contacts, and bigger one to send your location
upon request.  
If caller does not run the same app, they can simply send sms "w" and get back google maps link with location of the person 
they sent message to.
